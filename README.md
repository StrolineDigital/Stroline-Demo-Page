## Description
The goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability to create a basic HTML website with a contact form and a sticky navbar, announcing the arrival of a sit coming soon

## Usage
The goal of creating this site was to give a place to stage an upcoming website that has not yet arrived.
## Credits
Javascript functionality on the sticky navbar was borrowed and added to from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_navbar_sticky.asp and creation of the contact form was borrowed and added to from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp
All new code and edits to code were performed solely by StrolineDigital as even the borrowed code was not functional for this application without proper adjustment
